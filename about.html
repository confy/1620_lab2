        Hi I'm Adrian Mcfarlane and I'll be remoting in from North Vancouver this semester. I'm excited to get started learning about web design.

        As far as computers and electronics go, Iâ€™ve been using and tinkering with them my entire life. I know its cliche but as a kid I remember having arguments with my parents after I would take apart electronics and not put them back together. Nevertheless,
        a career in tech has always felt like the path. After graduating high school in 2015, I worked as a barista, ski instructor, art instructor, and finally my most recent job as a service technician at a local computer store. In this job I spent
        a lot of time building and repairing computers, fixing laptops, and setting up networks for businesses/ individuals. After working in this job for just over a year, I really had a renewed interest in finding a career path in the industry. After
        doing some research, BCIT seemed like the natural option due to the hands-on learning style, as well as the potential for a co-op position where I might be able to get my foot in the door at an employer. Ideally in a few years I would like to
        be working as a junior system administrator or somewhere in the emerging cloud computing field.

        In my spare time, I spend most of my time either playing piano or chess, hiking, skiing, or fiddling with my new server I've built out of some spare parts I had lying around.
